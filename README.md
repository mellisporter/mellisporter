## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

#### Thank you for visitig my GitHub Profile. A little bit about me...

I am a Junior Web Developer, building accessible websites for a variety of clients. I am a graduate of General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Program. In my time as a student, and my time professionally, I have used JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node, Express, React, Python, Django, PSQL, PHP, and more. 

As an educator during the pandemic, I became fascinated as we transitioned to using technologies that assisted virtual learning. I wanted to learn how I could contribute to these kinds of projects, which kickstarted my coding journey. This path has allowed me to solve complex problems in creative ways, all while continuing to learn and grow. I firmly believe in asking questions and staying curious!

I am excited to build platforms used by our future leaders and contribute to the technology space.
